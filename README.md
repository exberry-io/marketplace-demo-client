# Background
This appication was created for demo purposes.

The application is connecting to Exberry matching engine directly from the UI client.

:warning: This is NOT the recomended practice and shoud not be the case for any production application.

Production application should have a single server component that connects to Exberry matching engine, while the client UI interact with this component and not directly with exberry.
